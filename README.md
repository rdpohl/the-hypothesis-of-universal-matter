# The Hypothesis of Universal Matter

The PDF file "Hypothesis of Universal Matter" contains the central hypothesis for this project. A second PDF file, "Hypothesis of Particle Movement" extends the central Hypothesis adding further insight into the Field of {f}.

Two additional sub-folders provide additional support for the central hypothesis. Folders include papers for:
<ul>
<li>The Structure of Elements According the Hypothesis</li>
  <ul><li>Folder is StructureOfElements (Note: Folder has it's own README)</li></ul>
<li>Coded Example for Hypothesis Particle Sizing and Mass</li>
  <ul><li>Folder OnParticleSize. Contains Python code for report build</li></ul>
</ul>
