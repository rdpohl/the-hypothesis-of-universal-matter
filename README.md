# The Hypothesis of Universal Matter

The PDF file "Hypothesis of Universal Matter" contains the central hypothesis for this project. There is a companion presentation for this hypothesis found in the folder "OnParticleSize". The folder provides Python code that, when run, produces a report used to gauge sizing for the various elements in the hypothesis. The sections of the report can be run in corelation to the hypothesis.

A second PDF file, "Hypothesis of Particle Movement" extends the central Hypothesis adding further insight into the Field of {f}.

An additional sub-folder provide additional insight into the central hypothesis. The sub-folder "Structure-of-Elements" carries on from the central hypothesis and its build of a hydrogen atom, to show khow all of the other elements of the Periodic Table are constructed. Note: This sus-folder has it's own README.
